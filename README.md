# Freelancer Productivity Platform

A clean and unified platform designed for freelancers, contractors, and small dev teams to track work, log hours, manage tasks, share progress with clients, and automatically generate transparent invoices.

This system combines the practical structure of tools like Trello and ClickUp with an emphasis on accountability, documentation, and proof-of-work.

## Purpose

This platform exists to eliminate the administrative burden freelancers deal with daily. Instead of juggling multiple tools for tracking hours, managing tasks, writing updates, and creating invoices, everything is automated from real activity.

The goal is simple: structure the work, show the progress, and help freelancers get paid.
